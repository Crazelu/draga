# Draga

Draga is a collaborative multi-canvas drawing board originally forked from [JideGuru's Let's Draw](https://github.com/JideGuru/flutter_drawing_board).

## 🤔 Why the fork?
Let's Draw was originally intended to be a simple one page drawing board with collaborative drawing support.
Draga aims to be an endless canvas instead (much like Excalidraw) with more features and capabilities.
You can find more details [here](https://github.com/JideGuru/flutter_drawing_board/pull/8).
